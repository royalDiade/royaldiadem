                <p>
                    Royal Diadem was birthed by God himself through his servant Seth Simiyu Kitui God deposited the desire and passion and vision to him all the way from highschool but it was realised in 2018 where God brought two men under his care they passionately walked  together,encouraged and admonished  one another as far as the kingdom of God was concerned.God kept on adding numbers to the group which grew from two to five then twenty.
                    The members who gathered came with a passion and a desire to grow and to assist to Grow that's when the group focused more helping one another in spirituality, socially and financially.
                    As the days went by we had two scattered groups jars of clay and Discipleship group but latter God instructed the man of God to come up with one group and develop one another.On 25th february 2019 the real jouney begun where God specifically gave the man of God burdens of people who should be part of the agenda of the group now called THE ROYAL DIADEM.
                    Which means the sons and daughters of a God in his hands with a destiny that cannot be quenched.
                    The purpose of the group being setting men on a dieless passion and fire for God,cause them to live for God, please him and draw the whole generation to God.
                    Even though we've come along way with God we've seen nothing yet.
                    The devil has seen nothing yet what God is about to do to them that love him
                    We are only building capacity for exploits more to come.
                    See you at the top.grace galore.
